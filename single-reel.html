        After a successful collaboration with Grammy winner Boi-1da on
        Marvel/Playstation's Miles Morales score, John Paesano teams up with
        Egypt's biggest hip hop producer Molotof for the score to Marvel’s new
        series, Moon Knight. The show’s theme features Molotof’s beats woven
        under traditional Egyptian percussion and Paesano’s thematic orchestral
        score.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paesano, known for projects such as Marvel's Daredevil, Marvel
        Defenders, 20th Century Fox "The Maze Runner Trilogy", and
        Marvel/PlayStation Spider-Man is a composer of Lebanese descent, he has
        long looked for a project that would combine his modern film scoring
        with his middle eastern heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some really great collaboration opportunities to apply
        authentic middle eastern musical heritage, along with the sound of the
        Marvel universe. See Below
