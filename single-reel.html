        <p>
          After a successful collaboration with Grammy winner Boi-1da on
          Marvel/Playstation's Miles Morales score, John Paesano teams up with
          Egypt's biggest hip hop producer Molotof for the score to Marvel’s new
          series, Moon Knight. The show’s theme features Molotof’s beats woven
          under traditional Egyptian percussion and Paesano’s thematic
          orchestral score.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paesano, known for projects such as Marvel's Daredevil, Marvel
          Defenders, 20th Century Fox "The Maze Runner Trilogy", and
          Marvel/PlayStation Spider-Man is a composer of Lebanese descent, he
          has long looked for a project that would combine his modern film
          scoring with his middle eastern heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some really great collaboration opportunities to apply
          authentic middle eastern musical heritage, along with the sound of the
          Marvel universe. See Below
